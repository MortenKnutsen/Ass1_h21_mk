# Introduction

In this paper we will look at reproducibility and how R notebook can be a solution to this problem. First we are going to look at literature review, where we present what other scientific authors writes about reproducing. Then we will have our on discussion on how the necessity of reproducibility in research and whether the use of "R - Notebooks" is a possible solution to the problem of lack of reproducibility. In the end we will represent a conclusion to the chapter discussion.  



# Short literature review

There is on article about "*Do economics journal archives promote replicable research?*" written by McCullough et al, (McCullough et al. 2008). The article show how the data and the code to an article is important to have to replicate. There is several companies that are publishing articles that want a system that makes the authors to include the data and code when they publish, but most of them fail to achieve that. There are a replication policies that they can follow, that includes some requirements, on how to do it, and then have them in archives. The reason to many of them failed is that i was all up to the authors to do them right. The goal of replication is that authors or researchers can use other-minded articles to explore further, so they can avoid wasting time doing the same research. They also talks how the economics don't see the reason to replicate, but what else is the meaning of archives?
