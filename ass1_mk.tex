\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In this paper we will look at reproducibility and how R notebook can be
a solution to this problem. First we are going to look at literature
review, where we present what other scientific authors writes about
reproducing. Then we will have our on discussion on the necessity of
reproducibility in research and whether the use of ``R - Notebooks'' is
a possible solution to the problem on lack of reproducibility. In the
end we will present our conclusion.

When we are talking about \emph{reproducibility} it is about getting
confidence in the conclusion to the scientists
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcnutt2014}{McNutt, 2014}). The definition of
reproducibility is how other researchers can use the analysis of former
researchers to achieve the same result using the same analysis and data
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-samota2021}{Samota and Davey, 2021})

An \emph{R Notebook} is a document in R Markdown format that contains
chunks(\protect\hyperlink{ref-grolemund}{Grolemund and Wickham, n.d.}).
Such an R Notebook is a document that has direct interaction with R, but
it is also a document that are reproducible
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-grolemund}{Grolemund and Wickham, n.d.}). When
you are going to publish the document you can publish immediately or you
can \emph{knit} it into another format like HTML, PDF or Word.

\hypertarget{short-literature-review}{%
\section{Short literature review}\label{short-literature-review}}

\protect\hyperlink{ref-peng2011}{Peng}
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-peng2011}{2011}) tells us more about
reproducibility. He says that ``\emph{A critical barrier to
reproducibility in many cases is that the computer code is no longer
available}'' . This is one of the problems to reproducibility.
``\emph{Researchers across a range of computational science disciplines
have been calling for reproducibility, or reproducible research, as an
attainable minimum standard for assessing the value of scientific
claims}'' (\protect\hyperlink{ref-peng2011}{Peng, 2011}). Even if
reproducibility becomes a minimum standard, it does not guarantee the
quality. The ``R'' kite-mark is to indicate the idea that a
knowledgeable has reviewed the data and code and found it reproducible.
To make researches reproducible it is recommended for everyone that use
any computing in there research to publish there code. Even though the
code isn't clean, they should publish it, it just need to be available
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-peng2011}{Peng, 2011}).

@mccullough2008 argues that the data and the code in an article have to
replicate. Several publishers og scientific journals now want a system
that makes the authors include the data and code with their published
articles, but most of them fail to achieve this. There are replication
policies that they can follow, that includes some requirements, on how
to do it, and then have them in archives. The reason so many of them
fail is that it is all up to the authors to do this right. The goal of
replication is that authors or researchers can use other-minded articles
to explore further, so they can avoid wasting time doing the same
research. They also mention that many economists don't see the reason
why to replicate, but what else is the meaning of archives?

According to @mccullough2008 there are several authors who do not
include data and codes when they publish article e.t.c.. Possible
reasons why they do not publish is that they themselves have to sort out
all the data and check that the codes are correct, and it will take a
lot of time to do it each time. So in many cases the authors do not take
the time to include data and code when publishing. Sometimes they will
not let other authors do more research on the study they did, or use it
as a base, which then means that they do not publish with code and data
for the content (\protect\hyperlink{ref-mccullough2008}{McCullough et
al., 2008}).

It is a solution on how to increase the possibilities of reproducing
other works. Some articles show examples that archives can be mandatory,
this means that the authors must include data and code when they publish
so that the article e.t.c. will be in a system in the archive and can be
used again later. Using the R Markdown / R Notebook will make it easier
for the authors to have control over the code and data, because it will
always be included in the program. There are different chunks that allow
the data and coding to be included in the article without the author
himself having to set them up and sort them afterwards.

Code chunks are a series of commands in different programming language,
for example R. Code chunks preform calculations needed to produce the
appropriate output. Also to create intermediate results used across
different code chunks.

A text chunk, on the other hand, describes the results, codes, problems
and the interpretation. Text chunks is formatted for the user to read
it, not the computer.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

R Notebook can be a solution to fix the problem of reproducibility, but
only partially. The R notebook has the potential to be a great tool for
any researcher, but it requires researchers to know how to use the
program, and they must have exactly the same packages that were used
during the study, otherwise they might not necessarily be able to
reproduce the study. When you use R studio you can store your project in
a repository on Github, where you can save it as a public or private
project. After saving it in Github, you can drag it down to R studio
whenever you need it. Other Github users can also use your
repository/project if you make it public, and will then be able to use
your data and code if they have the same packages that you used. There
are also many researchers who want to protect their work and do not want
to make the codes available, and then it becomes difficult for others to
reproduce. For beginners in R it will be a lot to get acquainted with,
there are many different things you need to know before you can use it.
There are also many programs you need to install to do it optimally. We
think there might be some problems because when we use the R studio/R
Notebook in this way we always have to save it, commit it and push and
pull when we use github as our backup.

Under is some cons and pro on how R Notebook can solve the problem with
reproducibility.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  With R Notebook the document already contain codes.
\item
  It is a free program to use, everybody can install it.
\item
  You can use Github to store it longer.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  R notebook will not solve the problem reproducibility
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you want the data and code, you have to have the right packages
  that was used.
\item
  To use the program you have to know how to use it.
\item
  You need to download a lot of programs to use the notebook properly.

This function can help us to reproduce the research because it gives us
information about which R version and packages we used. It can take time
to install all the packages if you don't have them, but with chunks it
will be easier to find which packages we used in our work.

After the literature work we did, we found a lot of information about
how researchers feel about reproducibility. They want to protect the
work they do, and often they don't want to publish the code and data
they used to find their answers. Without the code and data other
researchers can't get the exact same answer, and they will have to take
the same exact test and use a lot of time to get the information. If the
author publish the code and data it would be easier for the next
researcher to just use the test that is already done and they will have
the exact same answer and can use it to develop it. When authors or
researchers publish with data and code, there will be a lot more of
opportunities of reproducibility. But it is all on the authors, when
they publish they have to check if the code and data are included.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

After we have read different literature and had an discussion, we can
see it is a split between the authors that want to publish their data
and code and those who do not want to publish. We conclude that the R
Notebook will help the authors or researchers to have more control on
the data and the code, but it's a program that need knowledge and
require different packages to get the exact same answer. Predictability
will help a lot when it comes to further resource, to don't waste time
on what others already have done, it also makes it easier to back up
what they got.

In our conclusion we will say that R Notebook can be a solution to fix
the problem of reproducibility, but only partially. We can use different
tools to make a good article e.t.c., and it also contains the code and
the data. But it is a little bit complicated to understand without
knowledge.
